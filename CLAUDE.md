# Claude Development Notes

Preferences and conventions for Claude when working on this codebase. This file is the always-on summary. Depth lives in three places:

- The `foldkit` Claude Code skill (vendored source, conventions, examples).
- Website docs at `packages/website/src/page/` (Mount, Command, Subscription, Submodels, OutMessage, best practices).
- The exemplar files below.

Read those when a rule needs context.

## Project Conventions

- "Foldkit" is always capitalized in prose. The only exception is the npm package name (`foldkit`) and import paths.
- In prose, capitalize architecture types: Model, Message, Command, Subscription, Mount, ManagedResource, CustomElement, Submodel, OutMessage. Keep lowercase for plain functions: view, update, init.
- Always use Schema types (not plain TypeScript types), full names like `Message` (not `Msg`), and `withReturnType` (not `as const` or type casting).
- Foldkit is tightly coupled to Effect-TS. Do not suggest solutions outside the Effect ecosystem. Check existing features in `create-foldkit-app` before suggesting new ones.
- Push back on any direction that violates Elm Architecture principles: unidirectional data flow, Messages as facts, Model as single source of truth, side effects confined to Commands. Flag the issue and propose the idiomatic Foldkit approach.

## Exemplar Files

Read these before writing code. They calibrate the quality bar.

- Library internals (`packages/foldkit/src/`): `runtime/runtime.ts`, `route/parser.ts`.
- Application architecture (`packages/website/`, examples, apps built with Foldkit): `packages/typing-game/client/src/` for Submodels, OutMessage, update/Message patterns, view decomposition.

The principles below apply broadly. Calibrate to the right context: library design when inside `packages/foldkit/src/`, application architecture elsewhere.

## Naming

- Messages are verb-first, past-tense facts: `SubmittedUsernameForm`, `CreatedRoom`, `PressedKey`. Verb prefixes: `Clicked*`, `Updated*`, `Succeeded*`/`Failed*` (when failure is meaningful), `Completed*` (fire-and-forget Command acks), `Got*` (child Submodel results only).
- Never `NoOp` messages. Use descriptive facts even for no-ops: `IgnoredMouseClick`, `SuppressedSpaceScroll`. `Completed*` mirrors the Command name verb-first: `LockScroll` produces `CompletedLockScroll`.
- Commands are verb-first imperatives: `FetchWeather`, `FocusButton`, `LockScroll`.
- Mount Definitions are verb-first imperatives like Commands: `AnchorPopover`, `PortalPopoverBackdrop`, `SyncSidebarScroll`. Result Messages follow the standard Message convention.
- Never abbreviate names anywhere, including callback parameters. Write `(tickCount) => tickCount + 1`, not `(t) => t + 1`.
- Don't suffix Command variables with `Command`. The type already says so.
- Prefix `Option`-typed values with `maybe`. Prefix `T | undefined` values with `nullable`.
- Prefix booleans with `is`.
- Name functions by their precise effect: `enqueueMessage`, not `addMessage`. A reader should never need to check a type signature to understand what a name refers to.

## State Modeling

- Encode state in discriminated unions, not booleans or nullable fields. `Idle | Loading | Error | Ok`, not `isLoading`. Make impossible states unrepresentable.
- Use `Option` for model fields that represent absence. Not `''` or `0` as the "none" state. Form inputs that start as `''` are actual values, not absent.
- Use `Option` at boundaries where the value will be matched or chained (`Option.match`, `Option.map`, `Option.flatMap`). Simple presence checks don't need it. Don't wrap in `Option` just to check `isSome`.
- Errors in Commands become Messages via `Effect.catch(() => Effect.succeed(ErrorMessage(...)))`. Side effects should never crash the app.

## Code Style

- Use Effect's `Match` instead of `switch`. For tagged unions prefer `M.tagsExhaustive({ ... })` over `M.tag(...)` chains.
- `pipe` is for multi-step data flow. Never `pipe` a single operation; call the function directly.
- In `pipe` chains, put the data being piped on its own line.
- Use Effect module functions over native methods in pipes (`Array.map`, `String.includes`, `String.indexOf`, etc.). Native methods are fine when calling directly on a named variable.
- Import Effect modules by their PascalCase name (`Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Function`, `Option`). Alias with a trailing `_` only when shadowing a needed native global.
- Never use sentinel values to signal absence (`-1` from `.indexOf()`, `null`, empty strings, `NaN`). Use `Option`-returning helpers like `String.indexOf`, `Array.findFirst`, `Option.fromNullishOr`.
- Never use `T[]` syntax. Use `Array<T>` or `ReadonlyArray<T>`.
- Never use bracket array indexing (`xs[0]`, `xs[xs.length - 1]`). Use `Array.get`, `Array.head`, `Array.last`, or non-empty variants.
- Use `Array.isEmptyArray` / `Array.isNonEmptyArray`, not `.length === 0` / `.length > 0`. Prefer `Array.match` when handling both cases.
- Never cast Schema values with `as Type`. Use callable constructors.
- Capitalize Schema literal strings: `S.Literals(['Horizontal', 'Vertical'])`.
- Capitalize namespace imports: `import * as Command from './command'`.
- Use `const`. Only use `let` when mutation is truly unavoidable. Always brace control flow.
- Extract magic numbers to named constants.
- Never use nested ternaries. Use `Match.value`, an `if`/`else` chain, or a named helper.
- Prefer explicit `if`/`else` when both branches return. Early-return reads as "A is exceptional, B is the default"; reserve it for true guards.
- Use `Readonly<{...}>` over per-property `readonly` for inline object types.
- Don't add type annotations or `as const` to callbacks whose return type is constrained by the outer API (e.g. evo callbacks, `Option.match`, `M.tagsExhaustive`). Let inference work.
- `Effect.acquireRelease` registers the release only after the acquire body completes. Construct the resource inside the acquire Effect, never before it. Anything else leaks on interruption.

## Comments

Don't add inline or block comments to explain code. If code needs explanation, refactor for clarity or use better names. Exceptions:

- Section headers: `// MODEL`, `// MESSAGE`, `// INIT`, `// UPDATE`, `// VIEW`, `// COMMAND`. One word, no suffixes like `ACTIONS` or `HELPERS`.
- TSDoc (`/** ... */`) on all public exports.
- `// NOTE:` comments, with a high bar. Only for behavior that would mislead a careful reader (timing dependency, upstream bug workaround, browser quirk). Not for normal patterns, state machine shapes, framework idioms, or what a function does.

## View Architecture

- Key every branching view. Whenever a DOM position renders different content based on a value (route tag, top-level model variant, sub-model, any tagged union), wrap it in a single `keyed` element with a discriminating key. Same rule applies to `Match`, `if/else`, and ternaries.
- Key mapped list items by a stable model identifier, never by array position.
- Key conditional inserts between stable siblings.

## File Organization

- `index.ts` is always a barrel; real code lives in a named file. For a module `foo/`, the shape is `foo/foo.ts` for the code and `foo/index.ts` for the barrel. Re-export via `export * from './foo'` and nest children as namespaces via `export * as Child from './child'`.
- Extract Messages to a dedicated `message.ts` when Commands need Message constructors. This breaks the circular dependency between `command.ts` and `main.ts`.
- Commands are colocated with the update function that returns them. Never centralize all Commands in one file.
- Expose a `boot()` helper alongside `init()` when a submodel applies a boot-time Message. `init()` returns clean state with no boot effects. `boot()` applies the boot Message via `update` and returns `[Model, Commands]`.

## Choosing Lifecycle Primitives

Five primitives: Command, Mount, Subscription, ManagedResource, CustomElement. Pick by what causes the side effect. The `foldkit` skill and the docs at `packages/website/src/page/core/` cover this in depth. Read them when ambiguous. Quick rule:

- A Message just dispatched? Command.
- An element exists in the rendered tree, and the factory uses the element to do DOM work? Mount. Use `Mount.define` for one-shot acquire-with-cleanup, `Mount.defineStream` for continuous events from listeners or observers. Both require at least one declared result Message.
- An external event source gated by a Model condition? Subscription.
- Model condition plus Commands need a stateful handle? ManagedResource.
- Rendering a native web component? CustomElement.

If a Mount factory doesn't read or write its element, you've misidentified the cause. Mount args are captured at mount, not refreshed across renders.

## Reference Repos

`repos/` holds vendored snapshots pulled in as git subtrees, pinned to the version we use. Read directly when API signatures or behavior matter; faster and more authoritative than docs or `.d.ts` files. Treat as read-only. Never import from `repos/` in package or example source.

- `repos/effect-smol/`: Effect-TS source. Reference for any Effect / Schema / Stream / Match / Result question.

## Commits and Releases

- Conventional Commits. Add `!` after the scope for breaking changes (e.g. `refactor(schema)!:`).
- Valid scopes: package directories (`foldkit`, `create-foldkit-app`, `vite-plugin`, `devtools-mcp`, `website`, `typing-game`, `examples-e2e`), example directory names, tooling (`skills`), infrastructure (`ci`, `release`). Never internal module names.
- Do not co-author or mention Claude in commit messages or release notes.
- Squash-merge only. `gh pr merge --squash`.

## Editing Rules

When making multi-file edits or refactors, apply changes to ALL relevant files, not just a subset. After refactoring, verify that spacing, margins, and visual formatting haven't regressed.

## Workspace Setup Errors Are Not Pre-Existing

If `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, or the pre-push hook surfaces errors like `Cannot find module 'foldkit'`, `Cannot find module 'foldkit/html'`, or unexpected `Property X does not exist` against an Effect API, the workspace itself is out of sync. These are not pre-existing branch failures. Run `bash scripts/cloud-session-setup.sh` to reconcile. The SessionStart hook runs this automatically, so it's only relevant if dependencies drift mid-session.

## Debugging Example Apps

Apps in `examples/` ship with `@foldkit/devtools-mcp` wired up. Reach for the `foldkit_*` MCP tools before adding logs. See `packages/devtools-mcp/README.md` for setup.

## Communication

- When I ask a question or make a comment that sounds rhetorical, opinion-based, or conversational ("what do you think about X?", "im asking you"), respond with discussion, not code edits. Only make code changes when explicitly asked.
- When I leave CLAUDE-prefixed comments in code, those are instructions for you. Search for them explicitly and address them. Do not remove or skip them.

## Prose Style

No em dashes in prose. You compulsively reach for `—` as a substitute for a period, comma, colon, parentheses, or semicolon, and the user has been removing them by hand for a long time. Default to a period and a fresh sentence. Comma, semicolon, parentheses, or colon also work. Applies to comments, TSDoc, docs, snippets, website copy, conversation, commit messages, and changesets. Document and page titles use a spaced pipe (`|`) as the breadcrumb separator (`"Calendar | API | Foldkit"`), never a dash. The only fine structural use of `—` is as a table cell separator. Only fix em dashes when removing them makes the writing clearer.
